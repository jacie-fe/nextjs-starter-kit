        Passwords alone are no longer enough! Cyber threats are evolving, and
        traditional authentication methods can leave businesses vulnerable to
        attacks. Multifactor Authentication (MFA) strengthens security by
        requiring users to verify their identity through multiple authentication
        methods before granting access.
      </div>
      <div>
        With MFA, you can prevent unauthorized access, reduce data breaches, and
        ensure compliance with security standards, all while offering a seamless
        login experience for your users.
